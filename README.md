# Prediction-diagnosis-of-diabetes-mellitus-A

## Problem Statement.
* Diabetes Mellitus is one of the deadliest diseases all over the world.
* It is rapidly affecting youth especially women. People are unaware of this danger.
* Some patients are already affected but do not realise due to ignorance of symptoms.
* Our attempt is to analyse the data and solve the above issues.
* To predict diabetes via four different supervised machinelearning methods.
* The main objective of this work is to establish an information system that provides higher accuracy for
    predicting diabetes.
    
## Data Loading
* I load the data by using url.

## Begun with EDA
* Where i clean the data and try to avoid each anomaly which can leads to inaccuarte results.

## feature selection 
* Here I used univariate selection and feature importance to get important features.

## ML Algorithms
* I used here Decision tree classifier, SVC, Naive Bayes, XGBoost. Also I tune the hyper parameters.

## Accuracy.
* Although I got good results with 94% accurate by using DTs & XGBoost
